## 📌 Project Objective
As part of Task 3 in my Data Science internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I built a **supervised machine learning model** using labeled data. The main goal was to train and evaluate a predictive model using a classification algorithm to solve a real-world problem.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Build and evaluate a model that accurately predicts target outcomes based on given input features. This could involve:
- Binary classification (e.g., survived or not)
- Multi-class classification (e.g., species of iris)

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
- **Dataset**: Common datasets used for this task include:
  - Iris Dataset
  - Titanic Dataset (for classification)
  - Breast Cancer Dataset
- **Source**: Public datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or `sklearn.datasets`

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- `Python`
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `Jupyter Notebook`

---

## ⚙️ ML Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling nulls
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (if needed)
3. **Train-Test Split**
4. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / SVM / KNN
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
6. **Result Visualization**
